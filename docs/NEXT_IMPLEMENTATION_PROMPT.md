# TradeYa Design Enhancements Implementation Prompt

I've been working on implementing the design enhancements for the TradeYa application, a platform for creative professionals to trade skills and collaborate on projects. We've completed Phases 1-3 and part of Phase 4 of our design enhancement plan.

## Progress So Far

We've successfully implemented:
- Foundation Components (Phase 1): Glassmorphism Card, AnimatedHeading, GradientMeshBackground
- Layout Components (Phase 2): BentoGrid System, Card3D
- Interaction Components (Phase 3): AnimatedList, Enhanced Input, Page Transitions, State Transitions
- Integration (Phase 4, partial): 
  - Home Page Integration
  - Trade Listings Integration
  - User Profiles Integration (just completed)

## Current Task

I need help implementing the final part of Phase 4: **Forms and Inputs Integration**. This involves:

1. Applying the enhanced Input component to forms throughout the application
2. Adding micro-interactions to form elements
3. Implementing animated validation feedback

## Key Files

The main files we need to focus on are:
- `src/components/ui/Input.tsx` - The enhanced input component
- Form components in the application that need to be updated:
  - `src/pages/LoginPage.tsx`
  - `src/pages/RegisterPage.tsx`
  - `src/pages/CreateTradePage.tsx`
  - `src/pages/CreateCollaborationPage.tsx`
  - `src/components/features/trades/TradeForm.tsx`
  - `src/components/features/collaborations/CollaborationForm.tsx`

## Design Requirements

- All form inputs should use the enhanced Input component with glassmorphism effect
- Form elements should have subtle animations when focused/hovered
- Form validation should provide animated feedback (success/error states)
- All enhancements should work in both light and dark mode
- Animations should be subtle and not distract from usability

Please help me implement these enhancements to complete Phase 4 of our design enhancement plan.
