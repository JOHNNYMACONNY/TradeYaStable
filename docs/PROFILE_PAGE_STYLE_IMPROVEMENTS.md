# Profile Page Style Improvements

## Status
- Implemented: July 2025
- Files impacted: `src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx`

## Changes
- Banner header added via `ProfileBanner` with overlaid avatar container
- Larger, responsive title and compact meta row with icons (email, dates)
- Accessible tablist semantics for sections (role="tablist"/"tab"/"tabpanel")
- Enhanced skeleton loader for banner and header while profile loads

## Rationale
- Improve visual hierarchy and alignment with design primitives (`Box`, `Stack`, `Cluster`)
- Establish consistent profile header pattern used across the app (cards vs page)
- Better a11y for keyboard/screenreader users on tab navigation

## Next Candidates (Optional)
- Sticky tabs on scroll and section anchors
- Stats row (followers, trades, reputation) with badges
- Profile completion prompts using `ProfileCompletionSteps`
- Cardized content sections with consistent `bg-card` and spacing

## QA Notes
- Verified no linter errors after edits
- No breaking changes to routing; data loading unchanged
