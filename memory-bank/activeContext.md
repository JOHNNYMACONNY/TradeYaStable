## Current Focus

* **Firestore Migration Infrastructure**: The project is currently focused on production migration execution with comprehensive testing and monitoring systems in place
* **Performance Optimization**: Advanced performance monitoring with RUM service, smart preloading, and asset optimization completed
* **Production Readiness**: Migration validation, rollback procedures, and production deployment infrastructure are fully implemented

## Recent Changes

* **Migration Testing Suite**: Comprehensive test coverage for production migration scenarios, rollback procedures, and data validation
* **Performance Monitoring**: Real User Monitoring (RUM) service implementation with critical path analysis and smart resource optimization
* **Production Infrastructure**: Complete production deployment configuration with phased migration execution and monitoring systems
* **Security Enhancements**: Advanced security monitoring, role-based access control, and comprehensive security testing

## Open Questions/Issues

* **Migration Execution Timeline**: Final production migration execution scheduling and stakeholder coordination
* **Performance Baseline**: Establishing production performance baselines for post-migration comparison
* **User Communication**: Final user notification strategy for migration activities
[2025-06-17 13:25:19] - **Current Focus**: Fresh Layout Implementation Plan - Strategic decision made to rebuild styling with clean Tailwind v4 approach rather than continue incremental fixes. Starting with Phase 1: Foundation (src/index.css) as lowest-risk, highest-impact first step.
* **Monitoring Alerts**: Fine-tuning production monitoring alert thresholds and escalation procedures
[2025-06-17 16:42:53] - **Current Focus**: TradeYa Dynamic Background Implementation Plan - User clarified they ONLY want the dynamic background from inspiration example, NOT fonts (Geist). Must preserve existing Inter font system and focus exclusively on WebGL shaders for fluid gradient animation using TradeYa's exact brand colors (#f97316, #0ea5e9, #8b5cf6). Remove all typography modernization from original plan.
