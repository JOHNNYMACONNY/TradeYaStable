**✅ CRITICAL BLOCKING ISSUE RESOLVED**: The messages page should now load without crashing. The missing `MessageProvider` has been added and all related type issues have been fixed.

**✅ LAYOUT INTEGRATION COMPLETED**: The messages page now uses the main layout component so the header and footer are visible to users.

**✅ MESSAGE READ STATUS LOGIC FIXED**: Corrected the flawed query in `markMessagesAsRead` service that was causing inefficient database operations.

**✅ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS IMPLEMENTED**: Reduced excessive re-renders and optimized data fetching with proper memoization.

**✅ ERROR HANDLING IMPROVED**: Added user-friendly error feedback and better error boundaries.

**Next Priority Issues**: The following issues should be addressed next to improve functionality and user experience:

1. **Input Validation Enhancement** - Add proper message length limits and content filtering
2. **Accessibility Improvements** - Add ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support  
3. **Advanced Features** - Message search, file attachments, and real-time typing indicators
4. **Real-time Synchronization** - Address race conditions and optimize listener management

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **Missing Context Provider (BLOCKING) - ✅ FIXED**

#### Issue: MessageProvider Not Configured

- **Location**: `/src/pages/MessagesPage.tsx` and `/src/App.tsx`
- **Problem**: `ChatContainer` uses `useMessageContext()` but `MessageProvider` is not wrapping the component tree
- **Impact**: **Complete page failure** - Messages page crashes with "useMessageContext must be used within a MessageProvider"
- **Severity**: **CRITICAL - BLOCKING** - Page completely non-functional
- **Status**: **✅ RESOLVED** - Added `MessageProvider` wrapper to MessagesPage component
- **Additional Fixes**:
  - Updated type definitions from old `Conversation`/`Message` to `ChatConversation`/`ChatMessage`
  - Fixed message read status logic to use `readBy` array instead of `read` boolean
  - Corrected timestamp handling in MessageHeader component
  - Updated participant data fetching to use correct types

#### ✅ Layout Integration Completed

- **Issue**: Messages page did not include header and footer navigation
- **Solution**: Integrated `MainLayout` component to wrap the messages page content
- **Changes Made**:
  - Imported and used `MainLayout` component in MessagesPage.tsx
  - Used `containerized={true}` prop to leverage the layout's built-in container and padding
  - Used fixed height calculation `calc(100vh - 16rem)` to properly account for header, footer, and spacing
  - Added `overflow-hidden` to prevent content from overflowing outside the container
  - Wrapped all component states (loading, not authenticated, and main content) in MainLayout
  - Updated loading state height from `min-h-screen` to `h-64` for better layout fit
- **Result**: Messages page now displays with proper header navigation and footer, with the chat interface properly contained within the layout boundaries without overlap

#### ✅ Message Read Status Logic Fixed

- **Issue**: The `markMessagesAsRead` function had a flawed query that was marking already-read messages instead of unread ones
- **Problem**: Used `where('readBy', 'array-contains', userId)` which queries for messages already marked as read
- **Solution**: Rewrote the function to properly identify and mark unread messages
- **Changes Made**:
  - Fixed query logic to get all messages and filter client-side for better reliability
  - Added proper type checking with `ChatMessage` interface
  - Added check to prevent marking own messages as read
  - Added batch operation limits to prevent large operations
  - Added validation to only commit when there are actually messages to update
- **Impact**: Eliminates unnecessary database operations and ensures read status works correctly

#### ✅ Performance Optimizations Implemented

- **Issue**: Excessive re-renders and inefficient data fetching in ChatContainer
- **Problems**: 
  - User data fetching triggered on every conversation/message change
  - No memoization of expensive operations
  - `fetchParticipantsData` recreated on every dependency change
- **Solutions**:
  - **Optimized User Data Fetching**: Only fetch missing user data instead of refetching all users
  - **Improved Memoization**: Added proper dependency tracking with `useMemo` for user data dependencies
  - **Reduced Dependencies**: Minimized useEffect dependencies to prevent unnecessary re-runs
  - **Debounced Read Status**: Replaced arbitrary 5-second rate limiting with proper 1-second debouncing
  - **Memory Leak Prevention**: Added proper cleanup for timeouts and listeners
- **Impact**: Significantly reduced API calls, improved render performance, and eliminated memory leaks

#### ✅ Error Handling Improved

- **Issue**: Silent failures and poor user feedback for failed operations
- **Problems**:
  - Errors logged but not surfaced to users
  - No centralized error handling for chat operations
  - Users unaware of failed operations
- **Solutions**:
  - **Integrated Toast System**: Added ToastContext for user-friendly error notifications
  - **Contextual Error Messages**: Different error handling for different types of failures
  - **Smart Error Filtering**: Only show user-relevant errors (not permission errors for background operations)
  - **Comprehensive Coverage**: Added error handling for message sending, user data fetching, and read status operations
- **Impact**: Users now receive clear feedback when operations fail, improving the overall user experience

#### ✅ Data Schema Standardization Completed

- **Issue**: Multiple conflicting interfaces across services
- **Problem**: `ChatConversation` and `ChatMessage` interfaces duplicated with incompatible structures
- **Solution**: Created unified chat schema in `src/types/chat.ts`
- **Changes Made**:
  - **Unified Types**: Created canonical `ChatMessage`, `ChatConversation`, `ChatParticipant`, and `LastMessage` interfaces
  - **Migration Support**: Added migration utilities and type guards for backward compatibility  
  - **Service Migration**: Updated `chatService.ts` to use unified types with legacy data migration
  - **Component Migration**: Updated all chat components (ChatContainer, ConversationList, MessageListNew, MessageHeader, MessageContext) to use unified types
  - **Proper Field Mapping**: Updated property references (`lastMessageTimestamp` → `lastActivity`, `read` → `readBy`, etc.)
  - **Type Safety**: Added proper Timestamp handling and type guards
  - **Legacy Cleanup**: Deprecated `chatCompatibility.ts` service in favor of unified approach
- **Impact**: Eliminated type confusion, runtime errors, and data normalization failures across the messaging system

### 2. **Real-time Data Synchronization Issues**

#### Issue: Race Conditions in Message Reading

- **Location**: `/src/components/features/chat/ChatContainer.tsx` lines 128-147
- **Problem**:
